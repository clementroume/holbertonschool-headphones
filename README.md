## Description

This project aims to replicate a web page based on a **Figma design** created by **Nicolas Philippot** (UI/UX Designer). The goal is to achieve a **pixel-perfect implementation** while ensuring **responsiveness** and **accessibility**.  

The webpage must:  

- Strictly follow the provided **design specifications**.  
- Adapt to different screen sizes, switching to a **mobile layout at 480px** width or less.  
- Use only **HTML and CSS**, without any external CSS frameworks or JavaScript.  
- Implement **semantic HTML** and **accessibility best practices** to ensure usability.  

The project is broken down into multiple sections, each focusing on specific elements of the page, from layout structure to styling details.
